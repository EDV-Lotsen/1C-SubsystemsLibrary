# 1C-SubsystemsLibrary

1C:Subsystems Library contains a set of universal functionality subsystems intended for use in applications based on the 1C:Enterprise 8.3 platform. These subsystems offer general-purpose functionality, such as user management, data synchronization, contact information, application settings, and much more. Developers can add some or all of the library subsystems to their applications. Thus, 1C:Subsystems Library eliminates the need to write this functionality from ground up and assists in redirecting resources to implementing the key application features.
