1. 1C:Subsystems Library 

1C:Subsystems Library (1C:SL) provides basic functionality demanded in the 
majority of 1C:Enterprise applications, such as user account management, 
scheduled job management, or e-mail operations.

1C:SL allows you to develop applications with built-in basic functionality 
from scratch, as well as quickly add new functionality blocks to your 
applications. Moreover, using 1C:SL ensures the uniformity of your 
applications, which makes them easy to deploy and learn.

2. 1C:Subsystems Library Demo

2. 1C:Subsystems Library is delivered with a demo application 1C:Subsystems 
Library Demo (1C:SL Demo). It is an accounting document flow management system,
which illustrates various 1C:Subsystems Library capabilities. 

1C:Subsystems Library Demo is not a ready-to-use application and cannot be used
for actual accounting purposes because the document flow process in this 
application is greatly simplified. For example, payments from bank accounts are
not implemented, and all of the payments are performed in cash. 

1C:Subsystems Library Demo can be used as a template for creating document flow 
management applications.
