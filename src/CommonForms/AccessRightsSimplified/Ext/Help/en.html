<p>Simplified mode for access rights management.</p>
<p>User access rights management is profile-based. A profile defines a set of actions with the application data the user is allowed to perform. Generally, profiles correspond to user job functions or duties. Multiple profiles can be assigned to the user at the same time, these profiles collectively defining their personal access rights settings.</p>
<p>To set up <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.ItemForm/Help">user</a> (<a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers.Form.ItemForm/Help">external user</a>) access rights, execute the <strong>Access rights</strong> command located on the navigation panel.</p>
<h3>User profiles</h3>
<p>In the <strong>User profiles</strong> list, select check boxes for the profiles required for the user's application activities. </p>
<p>Generally, a profile incorporates several roles. Assigning a profile to user automatically assigns them all roles contained in the profile. For example, the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile contains the <strong>Full rights</strong> role granting unlimited access to all data. Only application administrators (users with the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile) can set up user access rights. </p>
<p>All profiles are broken down into two categories:</p>
<ul><li>Primary profiles define a set of access rights sufficient to perform specific activities in the application. 
<p>For example, if a user only performs accounting activities in the application, they should be assigned the <strong>Accountant</strong> profile (as well as the <strong>User</strong> technical profile required for application logon).</p>
</li><li>Additional profiles are used to grant users additional rights not covered by the primary profiles. When a primary profile (<strong>Accountant</strong>, <strong>Warehouse manager</strong>, etc) does not provide sufficient rights they should be complemented with an additional profile (<strong>Counterparty communication</strong>, <strong>Unposted document printing</strong>, etc).</li></ul><h3>Access kinds</h3>
<p>This list is displayed to the right of the profile list, provided that the <strong>Use record-level security</strong> check box is selected in the <strong>Administration - User and rights settings</strong> section. The <strong>Access kind </strong>field is used to precisely define the data area accessible to the user. </p>
<p>An access kind is a rule governing access to application data. For example, you can use the <strong>Companies</strong> access kind to allow the user to view documents for a specific company only, to block the user from viewing documents for a specific company, etc.</p>
<p>Contents of the access kind list may vary depending on the profile selected in the profile list (to the left). Moreover, profile determines behavior of access kind settings: read-only access to documents, or allow editing. For example, if a profile includes the <strong>Product receipt</strong> document view role, users with this profile are only allowed to view these documents. However, if the profile includes roles that allow adding and modifying documents, user with this profile will also be allowed to edit these documents.</p>
<p>You need to specify <strong>Access values</strong> for each access kind. Select <strong>All prohibited</strong> or <strong>All allowed</strong>, or specify exceptions. Any access kind can be set up by two methods:</p>
<ul><li>specify the allowed value list. We recommend that you use this setup method when you only need to grant the users access to a specific limited data area. 
</li><li>specify the prohibited value list. We recommend that you use this method when you need to grant the users access to all data except specific areas. In this case, users automaticaly have access to any new data entered into the application. For example, if you set up the <strong>Companies</strong> access kind to prohibit the users from accessing documents belonging to Forward Thinking Inc., and then you create a new company (New Tech LLC) in the application, the users will not be prohibited from accessing any documents belonging to New Tech LLC. Please keep in mind that "allow" settings have priority over "prohibit" settings. If users from the above example are allowed to access documents belonging to Forward Thinking Inc. via any other group based on the same profile, they will have access to all documents belonging to this company. 
<ul><li>To create exceptions, click <strong>Add</strong> and select the required values from list.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In certain cases, it is expedient to specify item groups (instead of single items) in the prohibited/allowed value list. This facilitates the access rights setup procedure. For example, if you set up the <strong>Partners</strong> access kind to prohibit access to some of the partners, you can specify partner access groups instead of single partners. For this, you will need to create the list of partner access groups, and assign each partner to a group. These activities are not limited to administrators; any user with sufficient rights to edit the partner list can perform this.</p>
<p>For some profiles, the <strong>Users</strong> (or <strong>External users</strong>) access kind can be used for access rights setup. This only applies to the documents (and other applied objects) containing fields that can be used to specify users allowed to access these documents (<strong>Responsible, Author, Performer</strong>, etc). To grant access to all restricted data available to a specific user, you need to add this user to the allowed value list for the <strong>Users</strong> access kind. For example, if access to product/service receipt documents is governed by the Responsible field value, document posting will be allowed both for users specified in this field, and users included in the allowed list for the <strong>Users</strong> access kind. The "prohibit" setting follows the same logic.</p>
