<p>Print forms are available for many documents, catalogs, and other applied objects. The print forms can be generated as spreadsheets or documents compatible with Microsoft Word, OpenOffice.org Writer, Adobe PDF, HTML, Microsoft Excel, or as 1С:Enterprise <a href="CommonForm.PrintDocuments/Help">spreadsheet documents</a> (.mxl). To be able to generate print forms, it is not necessary to have the above software installed.</p>
<p>However, to generate and display print forms in Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer format, it is necessary to have the related software installed.</p>
<h2>Notes on print form generation in web client</h2>
<p>When working remotely, your Internet browser may require additional setup before you can generate print forms in the web client. Generally, you need to disable pop-up windows for the application website.</p>
<ul><li>In Internet Explorer, execute the <strong>Tools - Pop-up blocker - Pop-up blocker settings</strong> command. 
</li><li>Type in the application website address into the <strong>Address of website to allow</strong> field, click <strong>Add</strong>. The application website will now be displayed in the <strong>Allowed sites</strong> field below. Click <strong>Close</strong>. For more details on disabling pop-ups, refer to the web browser documentation.</li></ul><p>In Internet Explorer, make sure that ActiveX filtering is disabled. If ActiveX filtering is enabled, execute the <strong>Tools - ActiveX filtering</strong> command to disable it for this website.</p>
<h3>Printing in PDF format</h3>
<p>In the web client, print forms are generated in PDF format that can be either sent to printer or saved to a file. Therefore it is necessary to have a PDF viewer (for example, Adobe Reader) installed.  </p>
<p>If a PDF viewer was not installed or the above setup was not performed, any attempt to print a PDF print form in the web client will display a warning message. If a PDF viewer software (for example, Adobe Reader) was installed but web browser setup was not performed, select <strong>Open</strong> in the <strong>Open or save</strong> window at the bottom, and click <strong>Print</strong> or <strong>OK</strong>. Once the document is printed, close the printing window and click <strong>Close</strong> to go back to the application.</p>
<h3>Printing in HTML format</h3>
<ul><li>If a PDF viewer software (for example, Adobe Reader) can not be installed or used for any reason, you can change the default print form format to HTML. 
</li><li>For this, click <strong>Main menu</strong>, execute the <strong>Tools - Parameters</strong> command, select <strong>Print as HTML</strong>, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Print forms in Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer format </h3>
<p>To print documents in these formats, it is necessary to have Microsoft Word 2003 or later (or OpenOffice.org Writer 3.2 or later) installed. Moreover, for remote work you will need Internet Explorer 6.0 or later, with additional setup performed. </p>
<p>To perform the setup, execute the <strong>Tools - Internet options</strong> command in Internet Explorer. Go to <strong>Security</strong> tab, click <strong>Custom level</strong>, and select the following security settings required for the web client:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Use pop-up blocker</strong> - enable; 
</li><li><strong>Active scripting</strong> - enable; 
</li><li><strong>Allow ActiveX filtering</strong> - disable. 
</li><li>Go to <strong>Privacy</strong> tab, and set security level to <strong>Medium</strong> or below.</li></ul><p>For more details on web browser setup, refer to the User's guide, Section 13 (Working with web client), and Administrator's guide, Section 8 (Setting up web browsers before running web client).</p>
<p>When a document is printed for the first time without file management extension installed, the application will offer to install this extension. To start installation, click <strong>Install</strong>, then click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Continue</strong> to start installing the file management extension. 
</li><li>In some cases, you may be required to confirm the installation, due to local security settings. Make sure that the application publisher is actually 1C, and click <strong>Install</strong> to confirm. 
</li><li>Once the installation is finished, click <strong>OK</strong>. This message will be displayed only once.</li></ul><p>When a document is printed for the first time, the application will offer to create a technical directory for storing temporary print files. Select a directory and click <strong>OK</strong>. This message, too, will be displayed only once. To modify the selected print file directory, go to the <strong>Print</strong> tab of the personal application settings, click <strong>Print working directory settings</strong>, and select a local directory.</p>
<p>Then, the application will offer to obtain a template file required to generate the print form. Click <strong>OK</strong> to continue. The print form will be generated and opened in Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>If any settings are missing or invalid, an error message will be displayed instead. In case of error message, check all of the above settings.</p>
<h2>Editing print form templates in web client </h2>
<p>To modify and view<a href="InformationRegister.UserPrintTemplates.Form.PrintFormTemplates/Help"> </a>templates in spreadsheet document format, you need to have the 1C:Enterprise application installed. If it is not installed, you will be offered to install <strong>1C:Enterprise 8.2 - File workshop</strong>. To download it, click the <strong>Go to 1C:Enterprise - FIle workshop download page</strong> hyperlink, or visit the 1C website at <a href="http://1c-dn.com/developer_tools/fileworkshop/">http://1c-dn.com/developer_tools/fileworkshop/</a>. </p>
<p>When viewing a template in web client, click <strong>Continue</strong> to confirm file download. When opening a print form template in spreadsheet document format, you will be asked to open or save the template file. Select a directory where you want to save the file to. Then, run 1C:Enterprise 8.2 - File workshop to edit the template.</p>
<p>Save your changes, close the template file, go back to the application, and click <strong>End changes</strong>. To import the modified template to the application, click <strong>Browse</strong>, specify path to the template file, and click <strong>OK</strong>. </p>
