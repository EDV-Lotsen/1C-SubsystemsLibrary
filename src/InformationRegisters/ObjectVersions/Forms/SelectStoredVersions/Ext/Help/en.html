<p>This list is used to view object change history and choose between stored versions. Version history provides quick and clear answers to questions like "Who changed this object", "When was this object changed last", or "What was changed exactly". </p>
<p>This is a useful tool for document or list change history management, object version viewing, and object version comparison.</p>
<p>Before you can start working with object change history, you need to perform the initial object <a href="InformationRegister.ObjectVersioningSettings/Help">versioning setup</a>. Only the application adimistrator can view or set up version history.</p>
<p>To view version history for a list or a document, execute the <strong>Change history</strong> command located on its navigation panel. This command is available only to the application administrator, and only for the objects that support versioning.</p>
<p>The list includes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>#</strong> - version number. Versions are listed in descending order, with version 1 listed last; 
</li><li><strong>Change author</strong> - name of user that made changes to the object; 
</li><li><strong>Date</strong> - object change date and time; 
</li><li><strong>Comment</strong> - detailed information on the object version. This field is filled in automatically. For example, after a version upgrade, new verson number and upgrade date are added to <strong>Comment</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Viewing versions</h3>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Open version</strong> to view the report describing object status on a given date.</li></ul><h3>Comparing versions</h3>
<ul><li>Select two or more versions in the object version list and click <strong>Compare versions</strong> to view the report describing object changes between the selected versions.</li></ul><h3>Version rollback</h3>
<p>To roll an object back to an earlier version, select a version and click <strong>Go to version</strong>. Any changes introduced after this version was saved will be canceled. The <strong>Comment</strong> field is filled in automatically. For example, after a version rollback, new verson number and rollback date are added to <strong>Comment</strong>.</p>
