<h1>Russian classification of countries of the world (OKSM)</h1>
<p>Russian classification of countries of the world (OKSM) is a part of Unified System of Classification and Codification of Technical and Economic and Social Information (ESKK) used in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>OKSM is harmonized with International Standard for country codes ISO 3166-97 developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and with Interstate classification of countries of the world MK (ISO 3166) 004-97.</p>
<p>OKSM was designed to identify countries of the world. It is used during information exchange for a variety of purposes.</p>
<p>Unlike ISO 3166 and GOST 7.67 standards, OKSM, in accordance with Order <sup><a id="fa:1" href="#fn:1">[1]</a></sup> of Federal Agency on Technical Regulating of Russia, lists Republic of Abkhazia and Republic of South Ossetia since January 1, 2009, reflecting their official recognition by the Russian Federation <sup><a id="fa:2" href="#fn:2">[2]</a></sup>. </p>
<p>The classifier is divided into three sections: </p>
<ul><li>numeric IDs, 
</li><li>names, 
</li><li>alphabetic IDs. </li></ul><p><b>The numeric ID </b>section provides a 3-digit code for every country of the world, assigned sequentially. </p>
<p><b>The name section</b> includes a brief name and full official name for every country of the world. If full name is not available for a country in the classifier, full name of this country is identical to its brief name. </p>
<p><b>The alphabetic ID </b>section includes alpha-2 code (two Latin letters) and alpha-3 code (three Latin letters) for each country of the world. These codes are used to identify independent states, dependent territories, and major administrative areas within states, in accordance with GOST 7.67 and ISO 3166. </p>
<p>The numeric IDs have senior priority over alphabetic codes, meaning that numeric IDs are unaffected by changes in country names that can result in alpha-2 and alpha-3 code changes.</p>
