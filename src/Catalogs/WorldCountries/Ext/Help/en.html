<p align="left">This catalog is used to store information on countries of the world, as well as economic unions, regions and territories. The catalog data is used, for example, when selecting a <a href="DataProcessor.ContactInformationInput.Form.AddressInput/Help">contact address</a> country or a country of origin for goods. </p>
<p>To open the catalog, execute the <strong>World countries</strong> command located on navigation panel of the <strong>Integrated subsystems (part 2)</strong> section. You can choose to store only the list of frequently used countries in this catalog.</p>
<p>You can populate it manually or import data from the <a href="Catalog.WorldCountries.Form.Classifier/Help">Russian classification of countries of the world (OKSM)</a>. To open the classifier, execute the related command.</p>
<p>The list displays the following information:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Full name</strong> - these fields store brief name and full official name for every country of the world. Brief country names are used by default for country presentation or printout. If the full name is not in the list, it matches the brief name of the country. 
</li><li>
<div><strong>Code</strong> - this field contains a 3-digit numeric code for every country of the world, which can be used to identify countries according to OKSM. For regions, economic unions, and other structures not directly related to the country classifier (such as European Union), we recommend that you type in "--" into this field. </div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Alpha-2 code, Alpha-3 code</strong> - these fields contain two-digit (for Alpha-2) and three-digit (for Alpha-3) codes used to identify independent states, dependent territories, and major administrative areas within states, in accordance with GOST 7.67 and ISO 3166. </div></li></ul><p>We recommend that you only add countries from the classifier to the catalog when necessary. If information on a country has been updated recently but the country classifier does not yet reflect this update, you can edit the country data directly in the catalog.</p>
<h3>Manual input</h3>
<p>In specific cases it may be necessary to enter a name not available in the country classifier (for example, a name for a local region or an international community, such as European Union).</p>
<ul><li>To add a new country to the country list, click <img src="StdPicture.CreateListItem"></img> <strong>Create</strong>. 
</li><li>We recommend that you refrain from manually entering country names, as manual input increases error risk. 
</li><li>You will be offered to select a country from classifier. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm your selection. 
</li><li>Click <strong>No</strong> to type in the country name manually. Fill in the required fields. Instead of numeric codes, the <strong>"--"</strong> value is filled in automatically, because this value is commonly used in print forms for countries not present in the classifier.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
