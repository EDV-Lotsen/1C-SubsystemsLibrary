<p>Information on work schedules</p>
<p>Create as many work schedules as necessary on the basis of the <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars/Help">business calendar</a>. <a href="Catalog.Calendars/Help">Work schedules</a> can apply to the whole organization or to a specific department (example: warehouse work schedule only applies to warehouse).</p>
<p>Depending on work specifics of the organization or a department, work schedules can be prepared for a calendar year or for a lesser period. If necessary, work schedules can be expanded on a regular basis during the year, each expansion covering as little as several days ahead.</p>
<h3>Creating work schedules</h3>
<ul><li>Enter<strong> Description. </strong>
</li><li>Specify<strong> Schedule filling period</strong> (for  example, January 01, 2014 - July 31, 2014). You can do this by: 
<ul><li>typing in the dates manually. 
</li><li>selecting the dates from calendar (to access the calendar, click <img src="StdPicture.Calendar"></img>). 
</li><li>by default, the period starts on January 1st of the current year.  
</li><li>if the end of period is set to end of year, this field can be left blank.</li></ul></li><li>Select<strong> Business calendar</strong> used as basis for the work schedule. If only a single business calendar is available in the organization, it will be selected automatically. 
</li><li>Select<strong> Filling method</strong>. This allows you to choose between two work schedule types available: 
<ul><li><a href="#A">Weekly</a> (by hour) - set <strong>Filling method</strong> to <strong>By week</strong>. 
</li><li><a href="#B">Cyclical</a> (with user-defined cycle length) - set <strong>Filling method</strong> to <strong>By cycle. </strong>
</li><li>enter the cycle length (example: 5 days). 
</li><li>enter the cycle start date (example: cycle starting from 01.01.2014).</li></ul></li></ul><li>Create <strong>Filling template. </strong>For this, you can choose any of two methods: 
<ul><li>Select check boxes for workdays. This is sufficient to display both workdays and weekend days in the work schedule. 
</li><li>Specify work hours for each workday via the <strong>Fill in schedule</strong> hyperlink. Once this is complete, the hyperlink will change to display the total number of work hours and work mode. 
<ul><li>Specify <strong>Work hours </strong>for each workday of a week (or cycle) by clicking <strong>Add</strong>. Enter <strong>Start time </strong>and <strong>End time. </strong>Any breaks in the daily work schedule are indicated by creating multiple entries (work hours before the break, and work hours after the break). 
</li><li>Only work hours are included in the schedule. Weekend days are not included.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>If necessary, select the <strong>Exclude holidays</strong> check box. This will automatically exclude any dates specified as holidays in the selected business calendar from the work schedule. 
</li><li>If holidays are excluded from the work schedule and pre-holiday days are assigned a separate work schedule, click the <strong>Fill in schedule </strong>hyperlink to fill in <strong>Pre-holiday schedule</strong> (the procedure is identical to work schedule filling in). 
</li><li>Specify <strong>Planning horizon - </strong>if this is specified, the schedule filling period will be automatically compared to the number of months in the planning horizon, and a warning will be displayed if the schedule was not filled in to the required date. 
</li><li>Type in <strong>Description - </strong>enter detailed schedule information here. Filling in this field helps to navigate through extensive work schedule lists. 
<ul></ul><h3>Viewing work schedules</h3>
<p>Click<strong> Fill result</strong>. This will display all workdays and week-end days broken down by month. Click <strong>Fill setup</strong> to continue filling in the work schedule.</p>
<h3>Notes on filling<a name="#A"> </a>in weekly work schedules</h3>
<p>Weekly (or hourly) work schedules are defined for each day of the week. This is the most basic and common type of work schedule. <strong>40-hour workweek</strong> is a good example of this schedule type, as well as <strong>5-day workweek, 2-day workweek</strong>, etc. </p>
<p>To create a work schedule of this type, set <strong>Filling method</strong> to <strong>By week</strong> and specify <strong>Work hours</strong> for each workday of the week.</p>
<h3>Notes on filling in user-<a name="#B">defined</a> cyclical work schedules</h3>
<p>Cyclical work schedules are defined for specific dates; a date is selected as cycle day 0 and all other cycle days are numbered after it. Work schedules of this type are not affected by days of the week, and rarely affected by holidays.</p>
<p>Cyclical work schedule examples are: shift-based schedules, and sliding week-end schedules (one workday, three days off; two workdays, two days off; etc)</p>
<p>Let us review an example work schedule for a warehouse that works around the clock for 4 days, after which, the warehouse closes for 1 day for equipment maintenance and sanitation. In this case, the total cycle length is 5 days.</p>
<ul><li>
<div>Set<strong> Filling method</strong> to <strong>By cycle</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Specify cycle length (5 days). </div>
</li><li>
<div>Specify cycle start date (03.01.2014. The cycle starts from the start date of the schedule filling period (01.01.2014), but you can change this if necessary.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Create <strong>Filling template </strong>and<strong> </strong>specify <strong>Work hours </strong>for each workday in the cycle.</div></li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
