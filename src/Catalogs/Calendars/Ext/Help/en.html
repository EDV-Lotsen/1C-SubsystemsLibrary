<p>This list is used to maintain work schedules in use in your organization.</p>
<p>Work schedules are generated on the basis of <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars/Help">business calendars</a>. Work schedules can apply to the whole organization or to a specific department (example: warehouse work schedule only applies to warehouse). A department work schedule contains information on workdays adopted in this department.</p>
<p>Depending on work specifics of the organization or a department, work schedules can be prepared for a calendar year or for a lesser period. If necessary, work schedules can be expanded on a regular basis during the year, each expansion covering as little as several days ahead.</p>
<p>Work schedules with identified errors are marked in red.</p>
<h3>Setting work schedules</h3>
<ul><li>Create as many work schedules as necessary on the basis of the business calendar. 
</li><li>For each work schedule, specify workdays. Fill in each work schedule for as many days ahead as best for the schedule users' convenience. 
</li><li>At the end of year, fill in the work schedule ahead for several days of the next year (until the date of release of the official calendar for the next year), based on the last year data; this helps to avoid potential issues when preparing documents.</li></ul><h3>Work schedule data displayed in this list</h3>
