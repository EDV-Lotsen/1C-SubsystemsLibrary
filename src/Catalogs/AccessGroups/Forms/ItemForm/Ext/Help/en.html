<p>Description of access group properties</p>
<p>An access group defines a set of actions with the application data the members of this group are allowed to perform. Generally, <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.ListForm/Help">access groups</a> correspond to user job functions or duties. A user can be a member of multiple access groups at the same time, these groups collectively defining their personal access rights settings.</p>
<p>Access groups can be used to create and modify common access rights settings for a group of users performing similar activities in the application, for example, <strong>Accountants</strong>. </p>
<p>Administrator rights are required for access management. The user assigned as responsible manager of an access group is allowed to <a href="#1">modify member list</a> of their access group on the <strong>Members</strong> tab. </p>
<p>An access group is always linked to an <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupProfiles/Help">access group profile</a> commonly incorporating multiple roles. Once a user is added to an access group, they are automatically assigned all roles listed in the access group profiles. For example, a predefined access group <strong>Administrators</strong> is linked to the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile incorporating the <strong>Full rights </strong>role. This role grants unlimited access to all data; it is assigned to all application administrators belonging to the <strong>Administrators</strong> access group. </p>
<h3>Creating access groups</h3>
<p>To create an access group, you need to select a profile (we recommend that you start from this point), specify group member list, and define any access restrictions.</p>
<ul><li>Select <strong>Profile</strong>. The profile selection determines available rights (according to its role list) and available rights restrictions broken down by access kind: for example, restrictions related to <strong>Companies, Warehouses</strong>, etc. Any access kinds found in the profile will be copied to the access group automatically. 
</li><li>Enter access group <strong>Name</strong> that should reflect its purpose and restrictions by access kind (<a href="Catalog.AccessGroups/Help">for more information, see access group description</a>). 
</li><li>We recommend that you choose a plural name containing the profile name (as displayed in the <strong>Profile</strong> field) and clearly describing the access right settings assigned to this access group. For example, you can create access groups named <strong>Sales managers in Forward Thinking Inc.</strong> and <strong>Sales managers in New Tech LLC</strong> on the basis of the <strong>Sales managers</strong> profile.</li></ul><li>You can add a profile to an access group profile <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.FolderForm/Help">folder</a>. In the <strong>Group (folder)</strong> field, click <img src="StdPicture.Select" width="12" height="12"></img> to select a folder from <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.FolderChoiceForm/Help">list</a>. 
</li><li>Click <img src="StdPicture.Select"></img> to select <strong>Member type</strong>. According to the access group purpose, <strong>Member type</strong> should be set to <strong>Arbitrary</strong> (this allows to add any <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">users</a> or <a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers/Help">external users</a> to the access group) or otherwise. 
<ul><li>To limit your selection to a specific list, set <strong>Member </strong>type to <strong>Common users</strong>, <strong>External users </strong>(<strong>Demo: Counterparties</strong>), <strong>External users</strong> (<strong>Individuals</strong>), or <strong>External users</strong> (<strong>Demo: Partners</strong>). 
</li><li>You can also add external users and <a href="Catalog.ExternalUserGroups/Help">external user groups</a> to the access group (this may be useful for survey purposes, etc). 
</li><li>Set member type to <strong>Arbitrary</strong> if you need to mix both common users and external users in the same group.</li></ul></li><li>Go to the <a href="#1">Members</a> tab and fill in the access group member list. 
</li><li>Go to the <a href="#2">Access restrictions</a> tab and enter additional access rights settings. 
</li><li>You can also enter detailed information on the access group into the <strong>Description</strong> field. 
<ul></ul><h3><a name="#1">Attendees</a> </h3>
<ul><li>
<div>According to the selected <strong>Member type</strong>, corresponding user lists will be available on this tab for access group member selection. </div>
<ul><li>
<div>To add multiple users, click <strong>Pick</strong>; to add a single user, click <strong>Add</strong>. Select the required access group members from list. </div>
</li><li>
<div>To delete one or several access group members, select them and click <img src="StdPicture.Delete" width="16" height="16"></img> <strong>Delete</strong>.</div></li></ul></li><li>
<div>Fill in the <strong>Responsible</strong> field by selecting a user from the <strong>Users</strong> list. The user assigned as <strong>Responsible</strong> is allowed to change member list of their access group. </div></li></ul><h3><a name="#2">Access restrictions</a> </h3>
<p>On the <strong>Access restrictions</strong> tab, you need to enter additional access rights settings. Access restrictions can only be created on profile level. On access group level, access restrictions can only be elaborated, if allowed by the profile settings. In certain cases, profile-based access restrictions are complete and require no elaboration. In these cases, the <strong>Access restrictions</strong> tab will be disabled.</p>
<p>Content of the access kind list on this tab depends on the profile specified in the <strong>Profile</strong> field. Moreover, profile determines behavior of access kind settings: read-only data access, or allow editing.  For example, if an access group profile includes the <strong>Product receipt</strong> document view role, all members of access groups based on this profile are allowed to view these documents. However, if the profile includes roles that allow adding and modifying documents, user with this profile will also be allowed to edit these documents.</p>
<p>The <strong>Access kind</strong> field is used to precisely define the data area accessible to the access group members. An access kind is a rule governing access to application data. For example, you can use the <strong>Companies</strong> access kind to allow  the user to view documents for a specific company only, to block the user from viewing documents for a specific company, etc.</p>
<p>To set up the access restrictions, you need to specify a value list for each access kind.</p>
<ul><li>
<div>To fill in the values, click <img src="StdPicture.Change"></img> , or double-click. Specify <strong>Access values</strong> for each <strong>Access kind</strong>. </div>
</li><li>
<div>Two values are available:  </div>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>All prohibited</strong>. In this case, access to all data is prohibited by default; you will need to explicitly specify any allowed values. We recommend that you use this method when you need to grant the users access to a specific limited data area. </div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>All allowed</strong>. In this case, access to all data is allowed by default; you will need to explicitly specify any prohibited values. We recommend that you use this method when you need to grant the users access to all data except specific areas. In this case, users automaticaly have access to any new data entered into the application. For example, if you set up the <strong>Companies</strong> access kind to prohibit the users from accessing documents belonging to Forward Thinking Inc., and then you create a new company (New Tech LLC) in the application, the users will not be prohibited from accessing any documents belonging to New Tech LLC. Please keep in mind that "allow" settings have priority over "prohibit" settings. If users from the above example are allowed to access documents belonging to Forward Thinking Inc. via any other group based on the same profile, they will have access to all documents belonging to this company.</div></li></ul></li><li>
<div>You can specify a list of values or value groups to serve as exceptions for any Access kind, if necessary. For this, click Add in the Allowed (Prohibited) values list. Select exceptions from lists.</div>
<ul><li>
<p>In certain cases, it is expedient to specify item groups (instead of single items) in the prohibited/allowed value list. This facilitates the access rights setup procedure. For example, if you set up the <strong>Partners</strong> access kind to prohibit access to some of the partners, you can specify partner access groups instead of single partners. For this, you will need to create the list of partner access groups, and assign each partner to a group. These activities are not limited to administrators; any user with sufficient rights to edit the partner list can perform this.</p>
</li><li>
<p>For some access groups, the <strong>Users</strong> (or <strong>External users</strong>) access kind can be used for access rights setup. This only applies to the documents (and other applied objects) containing fields that can be used to specify users allowed to access these documents (<strong>Responsible</strong>, <strong>Author</strong>, <strong>Performer</strong>, etc). To grant group members access to all restricted data available to a specific user, you need to add this user to the allowed value list for the <strong>Users </strong>access kind. For example, if access to <strong>Product receipt</strong> documents is governed by the <strong>Responsible</strong> field value, document posting will be allowed both for users specified in this field, and users included in the allowed list for the <strong>Users</strong> access kind. The "prohibit" setting follows the same logic.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
