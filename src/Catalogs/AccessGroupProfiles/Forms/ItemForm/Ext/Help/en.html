<p>Description of access group profile properties.</p>
<p>A variety of predefined <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupProfiles.Form.ListForm/Help">access group profiles</a> is available in the application. However, in certain cases, predefined <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupProfiles.Form.ListForm/Help">profiles</a> prove to be insuffucient for the purpose of comprehensive setup of user access rights. In these cases, the administrator is free to modify the predefined access group profiles, or add new profiles as necessary.</p>
<p>Generally, an access group profile contains several roles and describes access kinds that can be used by the administrator to set up user access rights via <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups/Help">access groups</a>. In other words, an access group profile is a template used by the administrator for <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupProfiles.Form.ListForm/Help">access group</a> management purposes. </p>
<p>One or several access groups can be based on a single profile. For example, two<strong> </strong>access groups: <strong>Headquarters accountants</strong> and<strong> New York branch accountants</strong>, can be created on the basis on the <strong>Accountant</strong> profile, the former group granting access to Headquarters and the latter to New York branch.</p>
<h3>Creating access group profiles</h3>
<ul><li>Enter profile <strong>Description</strong>. 
</li><li>To add an access group profile to a folder, fill in the <strong>Group (folder)</strong> field. Access group profiles can be grouped by a variety of criteria. Click <img src="StdPicture.Select"></img> <strong>Select</strong> and select a folder from <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupProfiles.Form.ListForm/Help">list</a>. 
</li><li>Select <a href="#1">Allowed actions (roles</a>) on the corresponding tab. 
</li><li>Specify <a href="#2">Access restrictions</a> on the corresponding tab. 
</li><li>Enter <strong>Comment</strong> (any additional information on the access group profile), if necessary.</li></ul><h3><a name="#1">Allowed actions (roles</a>) </h3>
<p>When creating a new access group profile, you first need to assign a list of roles allowed for this profile, according to the demands of the target users.</p>
<p>A role defines a set of actions with the applied objects the <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.ItemForm/Help">user</a> is allowed to perform. Some roles may correspond to <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">user</a> job functions or duties, some - to more specific functions<strong>. </strong>For example, the <strong>Accountant</strong> role grants access to a set of functions needed to perform accountant's duties, while the <strong>Read files</strong> role allows viewing file contents. Roles are often used to allow viewing or editing specific data stored in the application.</p>
<ul><li>Go to the <strong>Allowed actions (roles)</strong> tab and select check boxes for the required roles. 
</li><li>Click <img src="StdPicture.CheckAll"></img> to select all roles in the list. 
</li><li>Click <img src="StdPicture.UncheckAll"></img> to clear all selected roles. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Selected roles only</strong> to show selected roles only. 
</li><li>Click <strong>By subsystem</strong> to display the role list: 
<ul><li>sorted alphabetically; 
</li><li>grouped by subsystem.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="#2">Access restrictions</a> </h3>
<p>The <strong>Access restrictions</strong> tab is used to assign a list of access kinds to the profile. </p>
<p>An access kind is a rule governing access to application data. Access kinds are used to precisely define the data area allowed to the access group members. </p>
<p>In an elementary case, no access kinds are assigned to a profile and data access rights are solely governed by profile roles. For example, if a profile includes the <strong>Product receipt</strong> document view role, all members of access groups based on this profile are allowed to view these documents. However, once you add the <strong>Companies</strong> access kind to this profile, you will have the option to allow the users to view documents for a specific company only, to block the users from viewing documents for a specific company, etc. To reiterate, the roles assigned to a profile define which data or functionality is accessible and which is not; while the access kinds assigned to a profile allow to define more precise conditions for data accessibility. We recommend that you assign access kinds to a profile whenever you need to specify complicated access rights for the group members.</p>
<ul><li>Specify <strong>Access kinds</strong>. Click <strong>Add</strong>. Click <img src="StdPicture.Select" width="12" height="12"></img> to select an access kind from list. To delete a record, click <img src="StdPicture.Delete"></img>. 
</li><li>For each access kind assigned to a profile, you can select any of the four available <strong>Access values</strong>: 
</li><li><strong>All prohibited, exceptions defined in access groups</strong> - select this access value to have access to all data prohibited by default. To allow access to an object, an exception must be created in an access group. 
</li><li><strong>All allowed, exceptions defined in access groups</strong> - select this access value to have access to all data allowed by default. To prohibit access to an object, an exception must be created in an access group. 
</li><li><strong>All prohibited, exceptions defined in profiles</strong> - select this access value to have all data access prohibited by default. Data access exceptions can be created in profiles only; access rights cannot be modified on access group level. These access kinds will be hidden from the access groups. 
<ul><li>When this access value is selected, exception creation functionality will be enabled. Click <strong>Add</strong>. Click <img src="StdPicture.Select" width="12" height="12"></img> to select values from relevant lists.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All allowed, exceptions defined in profiles</strong> - select this access value to have all data access allowed by default. Data access prohibition exceptions can be created in profiles only; access rights cannot be modified on access group level.</li></ul><ul></ul><h3>Viewing access groups</h3>
<p>For quick access to the list of access groups based on a selected profile, execute the <strong>Access groups</strong> command located on the navigation panel.</p>
