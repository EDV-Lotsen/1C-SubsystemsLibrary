<p>This catalog is used to set up contact information kinds in application documents and lists. </p>
<p>The application allows storage and management of contact information in use in your organization.</p>
<p>Contact information management principles are identical for all application lists. All lists include identical functionality for address or phone number management. Contact information storage in tabular sections of documents and contact information import features are supported. Contact information stored in tabular sections of documents is editable. This can be useful when working with accounting reports in digital format, as you will likely need to save an exact copy of information submitted to tax authorities (including addresses and phone numbers of individuals) to these documents.</p>
<p>The application is distributed with a predefined list of groups and list items. Each predefined list group corresponds to specific application lists or documents containing contact information. New groups cannot be added to the list. Items contained in these groups define content of contact information for the related applied objects.</p>
<p>In application lists and tabular sections of application documents, a variety of predefined contact information kinds is available. Besides, new contact information kinds can be added if necessary. </p>
<p>We recommend that you perform the contact information kinds setup during the initial infobase population stage. However, you are free to perform the setup later at your convenience. Generally, application adiministrator performs the setup.</p>
<p>To open the list, execute the corresponding command located on the navigation panel of the <strong>Integrated subsystems (part 2)</strong> section. This command can also be located in the <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong> section. </p>
