<p>This list is used for file storage volume management.</p>
<p>It is only utilized when the <strong>In volumes on hard disk file</strong> storage mode is active. To access this list, select the <strong>Store files in volumes on hard disk</strong> check box located in the <strong>Administration - File operation settings</strong> section. This will enable the <strong>File storage volumes</strong> command located in the <strong>Administration - File operation settings</strong> and <strong>Organizer</strong> sections. Execute this command to open the list. </p>
<p>The list includes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Name</strong> - the name of file storage volume; 
</li><li><strong>Fill order</strong> - an integer. Storage volumes are filled in order (ascending) until each volume is full; 
</li><li><strong>Max size</strong> - here you can specify maximum disk size allowed for file storage purposes on this volume (volume quote). To disable the total file size limitation, set volume quota to 0. When total size of all files stored in a volume exceeds the non-zero quota set for this volume, the next volume in fill order will be used for file storage. If none of the available volumes have sufficient free capacity for file storage, this event will be added to the <a href="DataProcessor.EventLog/Help">event log</a> and an error message will be displayed;  
</li><li><strong>Full path for </strong><strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> - path to the volume directory on Microsoft Windows server, in UNC format (<strong>\\Computer name\Directory name\File name\</strong>); 
</li><li><strong>Full path for Linux</strong> - path to the volume on Linux server; 
</li><li><strong>Comment</strong> - detailed information on the volume.</li></ul><h3>Creating file storage volumes</h3>
<ul><li>Click <img src="StdPicture.CreateListItem"></img> <strong>Create</strong> and fill in the required <a href="Catalog.FileStorageVolumes.Form.ItemForm/Help">fields</a>.</li></ul><p>You must specify one or several directories located on hard disks of server running the application or other servers in the network, to be used for file storage.</p>
<h3>Managing file storage volumes</h3>
<ul><li>When creating a new storage volume, volume path specified in the <strong>Full path</strong> field is validated automatically. If the path is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.  
</li><li>Storage volumes are filled in order (ascending) until each volume is full. You can exploit this feature in specific cases. For example, you can disable a volume temporarily by increasing its fill order number. 
</li><li>Path to an existing volume cannot be modified. 
</li><li>A volume cannot be deleted while it is being referenced by any file versions. 
</li><li>Volume access errors are recorded to the <a href="DataProcessor.EventLog/Help">event log</a> and can be viewed by the application adiministrator. 
</li><li>Files in each volume are stored in subdirectories organized by date. A new subdirectory is created for every day. All stored files retain their original names and extensions, with version number added in the middle. Example: original file name <strong>Orders.txt</strong>, version number <strong>1</strong>, resulting file name <strong>Orders.1.txt</strong>. 
</li><li>Toggling file storage mode does not affect the currently stored files; it only defines how the new files will be stored. For example, if you enable the <strong>In volumes on hard disk</strong> file storage mode, this does not move the currently stored files to volumes; only new files will be stored in volumes. To <a href="DataProcessor.TransferFilesToVolumes/Help">move the currently stored files</a> from infobase to volumes, execute the <strong>Transfer files to volumes</strong> command located on actions panel of the <strong>Organizer</strong> section. 
</li><li>If data synchronization is enabled between two applications and the source application stores files in volumes on hard disk, the <a href="CommonForm.CreateInitialImageWithFiles/Help">initial image creation</a> procedure must include creation of a compressed file containing the file storage volumes. 
</li><li>Accordingly, the procedure of initial image import to the target application must include specifying location of the compressed file with the file storage volumes. To <a href="CommonForm.SelectVolumeFileArchivePath/Help">extract the volume-based files from the compressed file</a>, execute the <strong>Store initial image files</strong> command located on actions panel of the <strong>Organizer</strong> section.</li></ul><p></p>

<td>Comment<br>To start using volumes located on network disks, you need to run the 1C:Enterprise 8 server on behalf on domain user (such as <strong>domain1\user1</strong>) with access rights to volume location specified as UNC path. This user must be a member of the <strong>Users</strong> group on the local computer, have <strong>Run as service</strong> and <strong>Run as batch job</strong> rights, and have access rights to directory where system files of 1C:Enterprise 8 server (event log, temporary files, etc) are stored.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>See also:</h3>
