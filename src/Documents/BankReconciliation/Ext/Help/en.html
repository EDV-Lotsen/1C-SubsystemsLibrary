<p>The bank reconciliation document is a tool used to simplify a monthly bank closing process. It compares cash receipts, deposits, and invoice payments recorded in the system with the bank statement. </p>
<p>Bank reconciliations generate general journal transactions. For detailed information about transactions that are generated when bank reconciliation is posted, see the <a href="AccountingRegister.GeneralJournal/Help">General journal</a> help section.</p>
<p><strong>To enter a bank reconciliation</strong></p>
<ol><li>In the <strong>Bank </strong>section, click <strong>Bank reconciliations</strong>, and then click <strong>Create</strong>.  
</li><li>Enter or select the following: 
<ul><li><strong>Bank account</strong>. The bank account used in the bank statement. 
</li><li><strong>Date</strong>. The bank reconciliation date. <br><br>This field is prefilled with the current date.  
</li><li><strong>Statement from date</strong> and <strong>Statement to date</strong>. The start and end dates of the bank statement. <br><br>The system will not allow you to enter a period that overlaps with another bank reconciliation. <br> <br>Once you fill the <strong>Statement to date</strong> field, the system fills the line items with documents that are reflected in the bank statement: <a href="Document.Deposit/Help">Deposits</a>, <a href="Document.InvoicePayment/Help">Invoice payments</a>, and <a href="Document.CashPurchase/Help">Cash purchases</a> within the selected time period. 
</li><li><strong>Beginning balance</strong>, <strong>Ending balance</strong>, <strong>Service charge</strong>, <strong>Service charge date</strong>, <strong>Interest earned</strong>, and <strong>Interest earned date</strong>. Fill these fields from your bank statement. </li></ul></li><li>Compare the amounts listed by the system with your bank statement and clear the amounts by selecting the <strong>Cleared</strong> check boxes against the cleared amounts. <br><br>During the reconciliation process, the system updates the following fields in real time: 
<ul><li><strong>Cleared amount</strong>. The total amount for documents that are marked as cleared. 
</li><li><strong>Cleared balance</strong>. Calculated as the sum of the cleared amount and the beginning balance. 
</li><li><strong>Difference</strong>. The difference between the ending balance and the cleared balance.</li></ul>In case of a successful reconciliation the <strong>Difference</strong> is reduced to zero. Locate and fix discrepancies, if necessary. 
</li><li>In the <strong>Memo</strong> field, you can enter notes on the bank reconciliation. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Post and close</strong>.</li></ol></body></html>
