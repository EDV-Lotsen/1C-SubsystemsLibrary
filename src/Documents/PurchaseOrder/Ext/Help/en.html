<p>The purchase order is the central document in the purchasing workflow. The system tracks received and invoiced items against purchase orders. </p>
<p>Purchase orders do not generate <a href="AccountingRegister.GeneralJournal/Help">General journal</a> transactions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<ol><li>In the <strong>Purchasing</strong> section, click <strong>Purchase orders</strong> and then click <strong>Create</strong>. 
</li><li>Enter or select the following: 
<ul><li><strong>Number</strong>. By default the system assigns consecutive numbers when documents are saved, and no user input is required.<br><br>You have the option to enter a custom number instead. Document numbers can include prefixes. For example, if you specify the number "PO-1", your next purchase orders are automatically numbered "PO-2", "PO-3", and so on.
