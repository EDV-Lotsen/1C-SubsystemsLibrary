<p>A sales invoice records a customer's liability to you and income from the transaction. It calculates cost of goods sold (COGS) and updates inventory balances. It also can be used for entering beginning balances. </p>
<p>Sales invoices generate general journal transactions. For detailed information about transactions that are generated when a sales invoice is posted, see the <a href="AccountingRegister.GeneralJournal/Help">General journal</a> help section.</p>
<p>You have the option to generate a sales invoice document from one or several <a href="Document.SalesOrder/Help">Sales Order</a> documents. In this case most of the sales invoice fields are automatically filled from the sales orders.</p>
