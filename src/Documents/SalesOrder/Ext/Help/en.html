<p>The sales order is the central document in the sales workflow. The system tracks shipped and invoiced items against sales orders. </p>
<p>Sales orders do not generate <a href="AccountingRegister.GeneralJournal/Help">General journal</a> transactions.</p>

<ol><li>In the <strong>Sales </strong>section, click <strong>Sales orders</strong> and then click <strong>Create</strong>. 
</li><li>Enter or select the following: 
<ul><li><strong>Number.</strong> By default the system assigns consecutive numbers when a document is saved, and no user input is required.<br><br>You have the option to enter a custom number instead. Document numbers can include prefixes. For example, if you specify the number "SO-1", your next sales orders are automatically numbered "SO-2", "SO-3", and so on.
