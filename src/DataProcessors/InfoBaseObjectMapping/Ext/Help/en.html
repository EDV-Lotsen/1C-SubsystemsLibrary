<p>Interactive data exchange wizard is intended for performing data export and import with a preview and mapping of imported data. Using<strong> Automatic mapping (default)</strong> command you can perform data mapping. <strong>Perform mapping </strong>command opens a form for preview and manual mapping of data that is going to be imported. The mapped manually objects are remembered and during next data exchange are mapped automatically. It is recommended to perform an automatic mapping first and then perform manual mapping for objects that were not mapped automatically.</p>
<p>The interactive data exchange mode is recommended to be used when the same object could be created independently in both exchanging infobases before the data exchange. It is useful as at a first data exchange when accounting in both infobases was started already. Because the probability of existence of same objects in both infobases is very high and they must be mapped manually. </p>
<h3>Object mapping procedure</h3>
<p>It is recommended to perform data mapping and import taking existing references into account. Especially if a field used for object mapping.</p>
<p>For example there is a Counterparty contracts catalog in the application that is subordinated to the Counterparties catalog. Mapping for Counterparty contracts is performed by owner catalog: Counterparties. Thus, mapping and import must be performed for Counterparties prior to Counterparty contracts.</p>
<p>Otherwise mapping table fields can contain bogus references like following:<br>&lt;Object not found&gt; (26:a0b9001b24e002fe11dfba347dd41412).</p>
<p>Bogus references is pointed to an object in current infobase that was not imported from exchange messages yet. </p></body></html>
