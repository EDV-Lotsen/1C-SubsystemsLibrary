<p>Interactive data exchange wizard is intended for performing the data exchange when it is required to preview the data that is going to be imported. This wizard allows to perform mapping of objects in two infobases for which the data exchange was set up. After mapping and data import are finished the data export is performed.</p>
<p>On the first page of this wizard you must select the exchange message transport kind and click <strong>Next</strong> button.<strong> </strong>When it is requered, you can open the data exchange directory and make sure that the required files exist and check exchange message transport parameters.</p>
<p align="left">On the second page of this wizard the data import summary and object mapping statistics are displayed. <br>By clicking <strong>Execute mapping</strong> button on the<strong> </strong>command bar you can open a form for previewing the data to import and performing the object mapping.<br>By clicking <strong>Automatic mapping (default)</strong> button on the<strong> </strong>command bar you can start an automatic mapping of objects in all table rows. Automatic mapping is performed using default mapping fields and most strict mapping rules. It is recommended to perform automatic mapping first and then perform manual mapping for objects that were not mapped automatically.<br>By clicking <strong>Execute data import</strong> button on the<strong> </strong>command bar you can start data import for all table rows. It is recommended to import data only after the object mapping is finished. If objects were not mapped then duplicated items will be created for not mapped objects during the data import.<br>Commands, listed above, are available to be called from the shortcut menu of mapping statistics table. When called from the shortcut menu these commands are applied to the selected table rows.<br>After all objects are mapped and all data is imported you must click <strong>Next</strong> button to export the reply exchange message. </p>
<p>On the final page of this wizard you will be prompted to open the data exchange schedule setup form. The schedule setup form will be opened if the current data exchange is not included in any of existing exchange schedules.</p></body></html>
