<p>It is possibile to terminate all active sessions (including the session of the user who initiated blocking) and temporarily block new connections to the application. This feature is useful when for administrative actions it is required that current users quit the application and do not log on for a while.</p>
<p class="Usual">The application locking can be started with following parameters: </p>
<ul><li>Period (time) when lock is started and ended; 
</li><li>
<p class="Usual">Message text that is displayed to users as a notification that the application lock is going to be started.</p>
</li><li>
<p class="Usual">Key code - an arbitrary string that can be used as a parameter of /UC launch parameter that allows to log on the locked application.</p></li></ul><p class="Usual"> </p>
<p class="Usual">To unlock the application before the lock period is ended:</p>
<ul><li>
<p class="Usual">Log on the application and open this form by executing Unlock command;</p>
</li><li>Open the application using "/C AllowUserLogon /UC &lt;key code&gt;" launch parameters, the key code should contain a value that was specified during application locking.</li></ul><h3>Actions that are performed on user side during the session termination</h3>
<li>
<p class="Usual">In 5 minutes prior to application lock start time all active user receive a warning regarding the planned application lock time and message text that was specified in application lock parameters.</p>
</li><li>
<p class="Usual">At the application lock start time an attempt to terminate all user sessions will be performed: a suggestion to save current work and exit will be displayed. Starting from this moment and till the application lock end time new connections can be established only if /UC launch parameter or UC connection parameter contains a valid key code.</p>
</li><li>
<p class="Usual">After 1 minute after application lock start time all active user sessions will be terminated. The standard actions for quit application will be performed: a quit application confirmation, a retail device disconnection and so on.</p>
</li><li>
<p class="Usual">After 2 minutes after the aplication lock start time all active user sessions that are left connected will be terminated forcibly.</p>
<h3>Additional functionality and restrictions</h3>
<p>It is also possible to prohibit execution of scheduled an background jobs in client/server mode. It might be required to provide additional parameters of connection to 1C:Enterprise servers cluster in Infobase administration parameters. Besides the Administration of 1C:Enterprise servers console can be used to lock and unlock the application. </p>
<p>In file mode the application can not be locked if an external connection using COM connection or web services is established or Designer is opened. In client/server mode in some rare cases some background jobs can not be terminated forcibly.</p></li></body></html>
