<p>The accumulation register aggregates usage is demonstrated on the Sales register as an example.</p>
<p>In the configuration to the Sales register aggregates are added. Also the UpdateSalesAggregates and the RebuildingSalesAggregates scheduled jobs are added with the corresponding schedules. To manage aggregates and scheduled jobs the <a href="v8:OpenForm=DataProcessor.SalesAggregatesManagement.Form">SalesAggregatesManagement</a> data processor is added (to use scheduled jobs a client-server version is required).</p>
<p>The sales aggregates management data processor form allows to enable the aggregates mode in the Sales register. On enable, the aggregates usage is rebuilt and aggregates are filled. In the aggregates mode it is possible to enable updating and usage rebuilding scheduled jobs. <br>The direct update, rebuilding and building the optimal aggregates are possible. This form displays the results of rebuilding and determining the optimal aggregates. The estimated aggregates size and the aggregates usage effectiveness are displayed. As a result of the optimal aggregates determination the form shows if the register aggregates of the configuration are optimal (whether they can provide the optimal aggregates list) .</p></body></html>
