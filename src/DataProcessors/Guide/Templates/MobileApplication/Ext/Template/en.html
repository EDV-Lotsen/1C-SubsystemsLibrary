<p><strong>Mobile application</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>The 1C:Demo application was developed as a demonstration of 1C:Enterprise mobile platform capabilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The application is an autonomous workplace for a sales manager that visits customers. In the standard scenario, the mobile infobase with this application synchronizes data with the demo infobase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following operations are available to the sales manager:</p>
<ul><li>enter new sales orders; 
</li><li>view previously entered sales orders; 
</li><li>enter new counterparties; 
</li><li>get warehouse balances; 
</li><li>view products and warehouse info (read-only).</li></ul><p>The following data viewing options are available:</p>
<ul><li>the document list with conditional formatting used to distinguish between order states; 
</li><li>the desktop form that displays sales orders entered at a specific date; 
</li><li>The <strong>Order analysis</strong> data processor that filters sales orders by price type.</li></ul><p>The warehouse balances report is generated remotely in the master infobase. The <strong>Warehouse stock balance</strong> data processor uses the report for getting balances by specific products, by all products, in a specific warehouse, or in all warehouses. The report can be obtained immediately on a request, or during the next data synchronization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The counterparties catalog demonstrates features specific to the mobile platform:</p>
<ul><li>make phone calls; 
</li><li>send text messages; 
</li><li>obtain current geographical coordinates; 
</li><li>get address by geographical coordinates; 
</li><li>display location on a map by geographical coordinates; 
</li><li>create and use multimedia (photo, audio, and video files).</li></ul><p>The Managed application demo application supports data synchronization with mobile applications. This includes:</p>
<ul><li><a href="ExchangePlan.Mobile/Help">Mobile</a> exchange plan; 
</li><li>The <strong>MAExchange</strong> web service for transferring exchange messages and prepared batches; 
</li><li><a href="InformationRegister.MobileReports/Help">MobileReports</a> information register for storing the generated report.</li></ul><p>Besides the application, the delivery kit includes a picture library (resources.zip) that you can use in development of demo applications for Android or iOS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before you start using the demo configuration:</p>
<ol><li>Publish the <strong>MAExchange</strong> web service for the demo infobase. 
</li><li>Install the mobile application on a mobile device. 
</li><li>Set up the data exchange between the mobile infobase and the demo infobase. In the settings form, enter the following: 
<ul><li>published service address; 
</li><li>user account for running the service; 
</li><li>whether user name and password are required.</li></ul></li><li>Perform the data synchronization to get the initial infobase state.</li></ol><p>When you start the application for the first time, it prompts you to specify the settings and synchronize data.</p></body></html>
