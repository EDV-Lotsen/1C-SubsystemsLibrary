<p>The report <a href="v8:OpenLink=e1cib/app/Report.WarehouseStockBalance">WarehouseStockBalance</a> have the BalanceByWarehouse command. For it the parameter type is defined as the CatalogRef.Warehouses and the default group is set. The BalanceByWarehouse command is added into the <a href="v8:OpenForm=Document.ProductExpense.ObjectForm">ProductExpense</a> document command bar, bound to the Warehouse form item. This command is automatically added to the <a href="v8:OpenForm=Catalog.Warehouses.ListForm">list form</a> and in the <a href="v8:OpenForm=Catalog.Warehouses.ObjectForm">item form</a> of the Warehouses catalog. <br>In the command module the parameter value is passed to the report form as the "Filter" parameter value. The report form analyzes this parameter and adds automatically values from this structure to the report's filter. In addition to the filter to the report form the "PurposeUseKey" parameter is passed, which allows the report, which is opened by this command to have its own custom settings. Thus, the user will be able to modify the opened report and its settings will be used next time he will open the report using this command. Also in the report form the "GenerateOnOpen" parameter is passed, which defines that the report must be generated immediately, i.e. the users will not have to generate it using the Generate command.</p>
<p>The system provides standard commands with parameters that can be used in forms. For example, a CounterpartyDocuments filter criterion provides a command for opening the list of documents. It is available in the command interface of the Counterparty's form, due to the command parameter corresponds to the type of the reference of the main attribute of this form. The default command is not visible, but in the configuration it is included in the form command interface edit mode. Some commands, such as opening of subordinate catalogs are visible by default. In the Counterparty's form a command like that is the Counterparty's Settlement Accounts list opening command.</p></body></html>
