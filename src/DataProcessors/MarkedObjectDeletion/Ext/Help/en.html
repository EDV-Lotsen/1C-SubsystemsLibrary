<p>Users with administrative rights can delete marked for deletion objects. Object deletion includes infobase integrity control. That means, the object (document, catalog item and so on) cannot be deleted if other system objects have a reference to it. You should remember that object deletion is an irreversible action. </p>
<p>You can delete a marked object in two ways:</p>
<ul><li><strong>"Delete all objects automatically"</strong> - system attempts to delete all marked for deletion objects. 
</li><li><strong>"Delete objects selectively"</strong> - user selects objects to be deleted. </li></ul><p>Once deletion is completed, the list of objects that was not deleted are displayed. Objects in this list are grouped by kind. Objects that have references to marked for deletion objects are displayed for each object. After that, you can edit objects that prevent object deletion and than try to delete objects again.</p></body></html>
