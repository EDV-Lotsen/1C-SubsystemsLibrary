<p>During development, it may be necessary to update the auxiliary data from time to time.<br>The list of possible reasons is provided in the form.</p>
<p>1. Generally, the auxiliary data is updated during execution of update handlers, mainly, the required update handlers (version *).</p>
<p>To update the auxiliary data as fast as possible, you can limit the procedure to execute the required handlers only (version *). Certain application properties will be monitored for changes. If no changes are found for some of the properties, the corresponding update phases will be skipped to optimize the execution time.</p>
<p>If you want to execute the required update handlers (version *) only:<br>a) specify the <strong>StartInfobaseUpdate</strong> start<a> parameter in the command line (using /C option) or in Designer;<br>b) set the <strong>Start </strong>infobase update constant and restart the application<br>    (not supported in SaaS)</a></p>
<p>2. In certain situations (especially during active debugging), handler execution can encounter errors.<br>In this case, some of the data will be updated while some will not. To ensure complete auxiliary data update<br>you need to execute the update through this processor, though this may take longer.</p></body></html>
