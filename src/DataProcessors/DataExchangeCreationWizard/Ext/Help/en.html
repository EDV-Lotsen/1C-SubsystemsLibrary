<p>Data exchange creation wizard is intended for creation of data exchange between two infobases. This wizard can be used both for creation of universal data exchanges and for creation of data exchanges in distributed infobase.<br>Creation of new data exchange is performed in two stages. First and second stages are performed in first (where it is started) and in second (where it is finished) infobase correspondingly. Settings are passed between infobases via file.</p>
<h3>During creation of a new data exchange the following data exchange parameters are set:</h3>
<ul><li>Data exchange method and transport settings, the selected method will be tested after that; 
</li><li>Restrictions of data migration between a pair of exchanging infobases; 
</li><li>Default values that will be used during data import; 
</li><li>Infobase prefix, if it was not set previously.</li></ul><p><br>On the final step of the first data exchange setup stage it will be suggested to save a file with settings for the second stage. In the beginning of the second stage you should select this file to continue creating the data exchange in the second infobase.<br><br>If the universal data exchange is created then on the final step of the first stage of data exchange setup it will be suggested to export data. It is recommended to export data in order to perform object mapping in the end of the second setup stage. In that case in the end of the data exchange creation the interactive data exchange setup wizard will be opened.</p>
<h3>Specifics of data exchange setup in client/server mode</h3>
<p><br>Note that in client/server mode the data exchange is performed on the computer where 1C:Enterprise server is installed. For 1C:Enterprise server running on Microsoft Windows this path will look like:<br>\\servername\resource<br>for server on Linux it will look like: <br>//servername/resource.<br>This directory should be available for read an write operation to OS user on behalf of which 1C:Enterprise server is running. If this not like that, the insufficient access rights should be granted or the user should be changed for 1C:Enterprise server and access should be granted to that user. The same recommendations are applied for data exchange over FTP resource and email. Read more about 1C:Enterprise server administration in 1C:Enterprise platform documentation.</p></body></html>
