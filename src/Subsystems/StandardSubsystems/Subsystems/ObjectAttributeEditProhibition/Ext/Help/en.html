<p>This application is used to protect the key object attributes (crucial parameters determining the nature of an object) from editing, after they are filled in initially. Generally, key attributes of a object influence behavior of other object (example: document posting). Unadvised edits of such attributes can result in discrepancies between the accounting data. </p>
<p>Examples of key attributes: the <strong>Currency</strong> attribute of the <strong>Cash desks</strong> catalog that determines the balance currency for given cash desk; the <strong>Is service</strong> attribute of the <strong>Products and services</strong> catalog that influences posting of documents related to given products or services. Once the balance is registered for a cash desk, or document related to specific products are registered, these attributes can not be edited any more.</p></body></html>
