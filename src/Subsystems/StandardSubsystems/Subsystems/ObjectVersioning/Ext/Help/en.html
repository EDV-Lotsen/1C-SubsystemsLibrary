<p>This application is used to maintain infobase object change history. Version history provides quick and clear answers to questions like "Who changed this object", "When was this object changed last", or "What was changed exactly". Versioning can apply to catalogs and documents. The application allows to view any version of given object, or to identify differences between two versions of an object. </p>
<p>Before you can start working with object versioning functionality, you need to select the <strong>Use object versioning</strong> check box located in the system parameter settings form, in the <strong>Setup and administration</strong> section. This will make the <strong>Versioned objects</strong> command available on the navigation panel. Execute this command to proceed to the versioning settings form.</p></body></html>
