<p>The <strong>My tasks</strong> list is where the task performer activities are carried out. The list displays tasks assigned to the current user. To group the list by priority, route point, author, or task subject, execute the <strong>Group by</strong> command.  When a task is assigned, the user can open the task execution form, examine the task, accept it, complete it, mark it as completed, or reassign it to another user. Tasks not yet accepted are marked in bold. To reject an accepted task, execute the <strong>Reject accepted</strong> command located in the context menu of the task list or in the <strong>All actions</strong> command group. </p>
