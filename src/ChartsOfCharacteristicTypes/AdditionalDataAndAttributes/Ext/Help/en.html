<p>Additional attributes and data are used in <a href="Catalog.AdditionalDataAndAttributeSets/Help">property sets</a>. Any additional attributes or data can be displayed in reports or lists.</p>
<p>When choosing between additional properties please refer to these guidelines:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Additional attributes </strong>are considered to be an integral part of objects with properties. They are stored in the tabular section of the object and can be accessed by any user allowed to access the object with properties itself. The additional attributes are edited in the object window, similar to other attributes. 
</li><li><strong>Additional data </strong>is used to store object data not considered to be an integral part of the object. Generally, additional data of the object can be viewed or edited even by users not allowed to access the object with properties itself. The additional data are edited in a separate window accessible from the window of object with properties.</li></ul><p>When selecting <strong>Additional value</strong> or <strong>Additional value (hierarchy)</strong> data type, you can specify a <a href="Catalog.ObjectPropertyValues/Help">list of allowed values</a> or <a href="Catalog.ObjectPropertyValueHierarchy/Help">values with hierarchy</a> for an additional attribute or data. For this, execute <strong>Create </strong>command from <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalDataAndAttributes.Form.ItemForm/Help">additional attribute or data</a> window. </p>
